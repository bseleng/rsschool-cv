            <h4>junior developer</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>the only front-end</strong> dev of the team with no mentor. my first job also.

              mostly outstaff projects with tasks like google/facebook authorization, decimal roundup, layout fixes.

              as of team internal work, i have completed small one-pager on <mark>react</mark> for mobiles with video playback and upload. another feature was theme change on click.
              
              currently (mar. 2020) i try to create an admin panel for company's leading product also on <mark>react</mark>.

            <h4>private language tutor</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>kind of sabbatical</strong>. took this time in my life to ponder over a series of seemingly poor decisions, to step back and finally start over with what i am used to: learning. it was the time i decided to get into it and become a developer.

             i used my background to mantain my existance and provide for those i care about. 

             not a fan of <mark>german</mark> per se but still have some clients. what really apeals to me to the day is <mark>english</mark>. i love the language and sometimes even the teaching process. the problem is that clients are mostly school kids who do not care.

              <strong>lots of</strong> different positions, mostly in foreign language-related areas: teaching, procurement, ecternal economic activities.

              as of now total waste of time and non-relevent experience. but i have some stories to tell over a <mark>coffee</mark> or even a <mark>beer</mark>.
