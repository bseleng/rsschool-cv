## summary
a private English tutor, who decided to become a developer.
 
    #### extended summary
    I've worked as a developer since October 2020. Our team has no experienced Front-End engineers and I am not keen enough to grow by myself. Neither me nor my company is satisfied with my progress, hence it is of my primary concern to figure out a way to change the tide.
    
       
    #### roadmap progress
    - [x] get the first paid job as a developer
    - [x] pick a specialization
    - [x] make SMART goals for salary and qualification level
    - [ ] get things done 
    - [ ] set new goals, repeat
