## summary
a private English tutor, who decided to become a developer.
As *[Batman][1]* said:
> I made it my business to know
 
### extended summary
I've worked as a developer since **October 2020.** Our team has no experienced Front-End engineers and I am not keen enough to grow by myself. Neither me nor my company is satisfied with my progress, hence it is of my primary concern to figure out a way to change the tide. 
   
### career objectives
* [x]  get the first paid job as a developer 
* [x]  pick a specialization 
* [x]  make [SMART][2] for salary and qualification level 
* [ ]  get things done before 30

### code samples

###### React
```javascript
/**
 * reads an url and returns the part after the last slash (API key)
 *
 * @returns {string} API key
 */
export const codeApi = () => {
    const currentLocation = window.location.href;
    return currentLocation.split("/").pop();
}
```

###### Yii2
```php
    /**
     * returns actual number of items in the cart
     * @return string number of items in the cart
     */
    protected function getCartProductCount()
    {
        if(!$this->orderArr) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return array_sum($this->orderArr);
        }
