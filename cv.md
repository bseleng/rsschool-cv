> I made it my business to know
 
### extended summary
I've worked as a developer since **October 2020.** Our team has no experienced Front-End engineers and I am not keen enough to grow by myself. Neither me nor my company is satisfied with my progress, hence it is of my primary concern to figure out a way to change the tide.
